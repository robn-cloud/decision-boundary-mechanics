# Irreversible Commitments

Most organisational decisions are reversible in theory but irreversible in practice.

An irreversible commitment occurs when an action changes the organisation’s exposure in a way that cannot be undone without disproportionate cost, delay, or secondary risk. The point of irreversibility is not always obvious at the time it is crossed.

Common examples include:
- Releasing funds beyond a recovery point
- Creating external contractual obligations
- Exposing data or systems to new parties
- Public commitments that shape expectations
- Shifting operational responsibility without a clear rollback

The defining property is not scale, but **asymmetry**: the cost of reversal is materially higher than the cost of proceeding.

## Exposure boundaries

An exposure boundary is the threshold at which an organisation’s risk profile changes.

Crossing an exposure boundary does not require failure. It requires only commitment. Many organisations implicitly cross such boundaries long before they formally acknowledge doing so.

Typical exposure boundaries include:
- Internal to external access
- Temporary to ongoing operation
- Exploratory spend to committed funding
- Advisory relationships to delivery dependencies
- Individual judgement to organisational liability

Once crossed, the organisation is carrying a new form of exposure, whether or not this is explicitly recognised.

## Why irreversibility matters

Irreversible commitments concentrate downside without necessarily concentrating authority.

In many systems, authority to initiate action is distributed, while accountability for outcomes is diffuse or delayed. This mismatch creates a structural incentive to defer explicit decisions until after the exposure boundary has already been crossed.

At that point, the decision is no longer whether to proceed, but how to rationalise what has already happened.

## Decision timing and default outcomes

A recurring pattern is that decisions are postponed until time itself makes the choice.

When no explicit decision is taken:
- Momentum becomes the deciding factor
- Silence is treated as consent
- Reversibility is assumed until it is no longer available

Time, in effect, becomes a hidden decision-maker.

This suggests that irreversibility is less about *what* decision is made, and more about *when* it is made relative to the exposure boundary.

## Minimal decision objects

For a decision to meaningfully exist before an irreversible commitment, it must satisfy a small number of conditions.

At minimum, a decision must:
- Name a single accountable owner
- Specify the commitment being authorised
- Make the accepted exposure explicit
- Be bounded in time

Absent any of these, what appears to be a decision is often better understood as intent, preference, or social alignment.

## Failure modes

Several common failure modes recur around irreversible commitments:

- **Drift**: repeated small actions accumulate into a large, unacknowledged commitment
- **Diffusion**: responsibility is shared socially but owned by no one formally
- **Retroactive justification**: decisions are described only after outcomes are fixed
- **Perpetual provisionality**: temporary states that never expire

These failures are not primarily cultural. They are structural, arising from how commitments are allowed to precede decisions.

## Open questions

Some areas this note does not yet resolve:
- How to identify exposure boundaries early without over-triggering
- When collective decision-making is appropriate versus single-owner models
- How different domains tolerate reversibility differently
- How decision artefacts decay over time

These questions recur across domains and suggest further analysis.
