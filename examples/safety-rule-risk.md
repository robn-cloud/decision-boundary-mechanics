Worked example: the safety rule that increases risk

An organisation introduces a strict safety rule after a serious incident. The rule is clear, mandatory, and framed as non-negotiable. It is approved by senior leadership and reinforced through training and audits.

Initially, reported compliance is high.

Over time, frontline staff begin to adapt. In situations where following the rule would create immediate danger or operational failure, they quietly work around it. These workarounds are shared informally and become normal practice.

Near misses increase, but formal incidents do not. Audit results remain positive.

From the outside, this looks like a culture problem or a training gap.

Mechanically, something else happened.

The boundary

The rule crossed an irreversible commitment boundary the moment it was declared mandatory. Non-compliance now carried disciplinary and reputational risk.

However, the downside of the rule being wrong or incomplete was not owned by the people who mandated it.

Authority to impose the rule existed. Ownership of the harm caused by strict adherence did not.

The missing properties

At the point of commitment:
	•	No role was accountable for harm caused by following the rule as written
	•	No mechanism existed to suspend or override the rule safely in edge cases
	•	No time-bound review was tied to real-world outcomes

The rule existed formally, but not as a decision with lifecycle and exposure.

The inversion

Once in force, the rule inverted incentives.
	•	Following it protected individuals even when it increased risk
	•	Breaking it reduced risk locally but increased personal exposure
	•	Reporting problems threatened the legitimacy of the rule itself

So risk was managed informally and invisibly.

The mechanism

The rule did not fail because staff were reckless or resistant.

It failed because a binding constraint was introduced without transferring ownership of its consequences. The system adapted to protect people, not outcomes.

DBM treats safety rules as decisions that persist over time and predicts this failure mode reliably when override authority and downside ownership are absent.
