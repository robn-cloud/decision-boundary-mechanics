Counterexample: the decision that settled and stayed settled

A regulated infrastructure operator identifies a class of assets that present an increasing failure risk. Analysis shows that replacement is expensive and disruptive, but deferral materially increases the probability of a high-impact outage within five years.

The organisation decides to replace the assets.

This time, the decision does not reopen.

The boundary

Before any work begins, the organisation explicitly marks the point at which the decision becomes irreversible: contract signature.

At that boundary, three things are done deliberately.

The properties that cross the boundary
	1.	Downside ownership is named

A single executive role is named as the owner of the decision. That role already carries accountability for outages caused by asset failure.

If replacement proves unnecessary or overruns, the cost sits with the same owner. If deferral would have caused failure, the same owner would have carried that consequence.

Authority and exposure are aligned.
	2.	Residual risk is accepted explicitly

The organisation records, in writing, the risk it is accepting by proceeding and the risk it would have accepted by not proceeding.

This is not framed as justification. It is framed as a trade-off that will not be revisited unless the underlying risk materially changes.
	3.	A time-bound closure is defined

A fixed window is set during which new information can legitimately reopen the decision. After that window, reopening requires evidence that invalidates the original risk assessment, not simply discomfort or cost pressure.

The outcome

During delivery, costs increase and timelines slip.

There is pressure to reconsider. That pressure is acknowledged but does not reopen the decision.

Questions are answered by reference to the accepted trade-off, not by re-arguing the choice itself.

The assets are replaced.

Years later, when a similar decision arises, the organisation reuses the same structure. The original decision is treated as settled history, not as a precedent to be relitigated.

Why this worked

Nothing about this case depends on exceptional leadership, culture, or maturity.

The difference is mechanical.

At the moment of irreversible commitment:
	•	Someone already exposed to the downside was made the owner
	•	The cost of being wrong was accepted, not deferred
	•	A legitimate end to deliberation was defined

Because those properties crossed the boundary together, ambiguity had nowhere to hide.

The decision existed.

Why this matters for DBM

This counterexample shows that the earlier failures are not inevitable features of complexity, politics, or scale.

When the minimal properties are present at the boundary, decisions survive exposure, time, and pressure.

DBM is concerned with identifying and enforcing those properties, regardless of domain.
