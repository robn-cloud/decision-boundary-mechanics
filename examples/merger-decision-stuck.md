Worked example: the merger decision that could not be revisited

Two organisations agree to merge.

The strategic rationale is well-articulated. Advisors are engaged. Boards approve the transaction. The merger is announced publicly.

Integration begins.

Within a year, significant issues emerge. Systems do not align. Cultural friction slows execution. Expected synergies do not materialise. Senior leaders privately acknowledge that assumptions were wrong.

Publicly, commitment intensifies.

From the outside, this looks like optimism bias or sunk-cost fallacy.

Mechanically, something else happened.

The boundary

The merger crossed multiple irreversible commitment boundaries very early:
	•	Public announcement
	•	Legal execution
	•	Leadership appointments
	•	Brand integration

From that point on, reversal carried existential reputational and financial cost.

However, no single decision-maker retained ownership of the downside of the merger failing.

Authority was collective. Exposure was diffuse.

The missing properties

At the moment of commitment:
	•	There was no named owner of the risk that synergies would not materialise
	•	There was no explicit acceptance of the cost of partial or full failure
	•	There was no legitimate off-ramp short of catastrophic unwinding

The decision existed legally and socially, but not mechanically as a revisitable choice.

The hardening

Once problems surfaced:
	•	Admitting error threatened leadership credibility
	•	Revisiting assumptions implied governance failure
	•	Continuing became safer than correcting

Integration activity increased, not because it was effective, but because motion signalled commitment.

The mechanism

The merger did not fail because leaders were irrational.

It failed because an irreversible decision was made without preserving ownership of downside or creating survivable exit conditions. Once the boundary was crossed, the system optimised for justification rather than correction.

DBM predicts this behaviour wherever commitment becomes identity-defining.
