Worked example: the decision that never quite happened

An organisation agrees that a legacy system must be replaced.

Everyone involved believes this is already a decision. Funding is discussed. Risks are logged. A programme is named. Slides exist. Work begins.

Six months later, delivery slows. Questions reappear that were assumed to be settled. Senior stakeholders ask whether replacement is really necessary, whether a smaller remediation would suffice, whether timing could shift. The team responds by producing more analysis, more justification, and more evidence that the original direction was sound.

From the outside, this looks like poor execution or weak governance.

Mechanically, something else happened.

The boundary

The organisation crossed a commitment boundary when it began spending money, assigning people, and creating dependencies. Exposure became real. Reversal now carried cost and embarrassment.

However, at the moment that boundary was crossed, no single actor was exposed to the downside of being wrong.

Authority to initiate work existed. Ownership of the consequences did not.

The missing properties

At the point of commitment, several minimal properties were absent:
	•	No named owner who would carry the cost of reversal or failure
	•	No explicit statement of what risk was being accepted if the replacement did not proceed
	•	No time-bound window after which the decision would be treated as settled rather than provisional

As a result, the decision existed socially but not mechanically.

The drift

Once exposure increased, ambiguity became useful.

No one could be accused of making the wrong call because, in practice, no one had made a fully specified one. Questions resurfaced because they had never been structurally closed. Requests for more analysis felt responsible rather than evasive.

What looks like indecision is better understood as a decision that never crossed the boundary required to exist.

The failure mode

By the time the organisation realises it is stuck, it is too late to recreate the original decision cleanly.
	•	Reversing course is now politically expensive
	•	Continuing feels risky but unavoidable
	•	Justification replaces choice

At this stage, governance forums become theatres for reassurance rather than decision-making. Escalation increases, but ownership does not.

The mechanism

The outcome was not caused by culture, capability, or intent.

It followed inevitably from crossing a commitment boundary without first ensuring that the decision had the minimal properties required to survive contact with exposure and time.

DBM is concerned with identifying these moments before they harden, and with explaining why once they do, familiar remedies stop working.
