Worked example: the policy that everyone follows and no one owns

A public body announces a new policy intended to reduce a well-known risk. The policy is approved at senior level, communicated clearly, and widely welcomed. It aligns with stated values and carries visible executive support.

Operational teams begin adapting their processes to comply. Training materials are updated. Reporting metrics are defined. Compliance is tracked.

Two years later, the risk the policy was meant to address has not materially changed. Frontline staff quietly work around the policy in edge cases. Managers treat breaches as judgement calls. Auditors note inconsistency but no formal non-compliance.

From the outside, this looks like weak enforcement or cultural resistance.

Mechanically, something else happened.

The boundary

The commitment boundary was crossed when the policy was announced and embedded into formal expectations. From that point, deviation carried reputational and, in some cases, disciplinary exposure.

However, no single role was exposed to the downside of the policy failing to achieve its stated outcome.

Authority to issue the policy existed. Ownership of its effectiveness did not.

The missing properties

At the point of commitment, several minimal properties were absent:
	•	No owner accountable for the risk persisting despite compliance
	•	No explicit acceptance of residual risk if the policy proved insufficient
	•	No mechanism for revisiting or retiring the policy once embedded

The policy existed administratively but not mechanically.

The stabilisation

Once operationalised, the policy became difficult to challenge.

Questioning its effectiveness could be interpreted as non-compliance. Frontline adaptations were tolerated because strict enforcement would have caused visible harm elsewhere. Managers focused on metrics that demonstrated adherence rather than impact.

Ambiguity now served a stabilising function.

The failure mode

Over time, the policy became untouchable but ineffective.
	•	Changing it implied earlier error
	•	Enforcing it strictly created new risks
	•	Retiring it would require someone to own the consequences

The organisation adapted around the policy instead of through it.

The mechanism

The outcome did not arise from poor intent or weak controls.

It followed from introducing a binding expectation without first ensuring that responsibility for outcomes, not just adherence, crossed the same commitment boundary.

DBM treats policies as decisions that persist over time, and applies the same mechanics to explain why many become permanent fixtures without delivering the change they were meant to create.
