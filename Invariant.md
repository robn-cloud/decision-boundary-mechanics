The Decision Boundary Invariant

A decision only exists if, at the point of irreversible commitment, three properties cross the boundary together:

1.	Downside ownership
A single, identifiable role must carry the material consequences of being wrong.
Authority without exposure produces activity, not decisions.

2.	Explicit trade-off acceptance
The costs and risks of proceeding and of not proceeding must be acknowledged and accepted as a choice, not left implicit or justified later.

3.	Closure under time
There must be a defined point after which the decision is treated as settled, and a clear standard for what evidence is sufficient to reopen it.

If any one of these properties fails to cross the commitment boundary, ambiguity becomes structurally useful. The system will continue to act while avoiding full ownership, and the “decision” will remain socially referenced but mechanically absent.

Corollaries
	•	Compliance, motion, or consensus are not substitutes for a decision.
	•	Analysis that continues after commitment is usually a symptom of missing ownership, not of prudence.
	•	Re-litigation is not a behavioural failure but a mechanical consequence of an incomplete boundary crossing.
	•	Governance mechanisms that operate after commitment cannot repair a boundary that was crossed incorrectly.

Implication

Most decision failures are not failures of intelligence, intent, or culture.

They are failures to ensure that ownership, trade-offs, and closure travel together at the moment commitment becomes irreversible.

DBM exists to make that moment visible.
