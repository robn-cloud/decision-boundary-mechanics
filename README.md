# Decision Boundary Mechanics

Working notes on how organisations force decisions at points of irreversible commitment.

This repository is a research notebook, not a framework, methodology, or product. It captures general, domain-agnostic patterns around ownership, exposure, and decision settlement that appear in many industries.

These notes are not derived from, and are not intended to describe, any specific organisation’s internal processes, systems, or data.

## What this covers

- Irreversible commitments and “exposure boundaries”
- Ownership vs authority in decision-making
- Time as a forcing function (decision windows, expiry, defaults)
- How ambiguity persists (and why it is often useful)
- Failure modes: drift, diffusion of responsibility, and silent scope change
- Minimal decision objects and what they must contain to be enforceable

## What this does not cover

- Implementation guidance for any specific company
- Operational playbooks, governance designs, or templates
- Security, compliance, or IT process prescriptions
- Tooling, automation, or product roadmaps

## Structure

- `notes/` contains evolving essays and definitions
- `examples/` contains cross-domain illustrations (not tied to any employer)
- `figures/` contains diagrams where useful

## Status

Early-stage notes. Expect incompleteness and revision over time.
