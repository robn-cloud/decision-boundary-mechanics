Decision Boundary Mechanics

Decision Boundary Mechanics examines what happens to decisions at the point where commitment becomes irreversible.

Most organisational failures do not come from poor analysis, lack of intelligence, or absence of process. They arise at the moment when a choice crosses a boundary and creates exposure, cost, or obligation that cannot be easily unwound. At that point, familiar tools lose power. Ownership blurs, time stretches, justification replaces choice, and decisions that were once live become socially frozen.

DBM is concerned with those moments.

It documents recurring mechanical patterns that appear whenever organisations commit to action under uncertainty, scale, or pressure. These patterns recur across industries and domains because they are structural, not cultural.

This repository exists to make those mechanics visible.

What DBM covers

DBM focuses on the minimal properties that must exist for a decision to settle meaningfully once commitment is unavoidable. The emphasis is on mechanisms rather than prescriptions.

Key areas include:
	•	Irreversible commitments and exposure boundaries
	•	Ownership versus authority at the point of commitment
	•	Time as a forcing function and a source of decay
	•	How ambiguity persists and why it is often structurally useful
	•	Common failure modes such as drift, diffusion of responsibility, delayed escalation, and retrospective justification
	•	The conditions under which a decision can be said to exist in a real sense, rather than as narrative or intent

The intent is to describe what happens, reliably and repeatedly, when decisions meet reality.

How to use this repository

This repository is structured as a growing body of analytical material rather than a finished manual.
	•	notes/ contains evolving analyses of specific mechanisms
	•	examples/ contains cross-domain illustrations showing the same mechanics recurring in different settings
	•	figures/ contains diagrams where they materially improve clarity

Readers typically arrive here when their existing structures have stopped producing decisions that stick. DBM is designed to be read selectively, at the point where something feels wrong but is hard to name.

Status

This is an early, foundational body of work.

The material is intentionally minimal and incomplete in surface area, while aiming to be precise in what it does cover. Concepts are added only when they describe a mechanism that recurs reliably under commitment pressure.

Expect revision, tightening, and occasional removal as the mechanics are clarified.
