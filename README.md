# Decision Boundary Mechanics

Working notes on how organisations force decisions at points of irreversible commitment.

This repository is a research notebook, not a framework, methodology, or product. It captures general, domain-agnostic patterns around ownership, exposure, and decision settlement that recur across many industries.

These notes are not derived from, and are not intended to describe, any specific organisation’s internal processes, systems, or data.

## Scope

The focus is on mechanisms rather than implementations, including:

- Irreversible commitments and exposure boundaries
- Ownership versus authority in decision-making
- Time as a forcing function
- How ambiguity persists and why it is often structurally useful
- Common failure modes such as drift, diffusion of responsibility, and retroactive justification
- Minimal properties a decision must have to exist meaningfully before commitment

## Out of scope

This repository deliberately does not cover:

- Implementation guidance for any specific organisation
- Governance models, operating models, or playbooks
- Security, compliance, or IT process prescriptions
- Tooling, automation, or product designs

## Structure

- `notes/` contains evolving analytical notes
- `examples/` contains cross-domain illustrations
- `figures/` contains diagrams where useful

## Status

Early-stage working notes. Incomplete by design and subject to revision.
