# Existential Physics
## A Structural Physics Ordered by Operator Complexity

# I. Operator Complexity Metric

## Primitive Operators

Let the primitive operator set be:

- σ  := Gradient / Imbalance
- τ  := Horizon / Temporal Exposure
- κ  := Constraint Topology / Admissibility
- ω  := Closure / Commitment

Let Ω = {σ, τ, κ, ω}

---

## 1. Operator State

Define an operator system S as:

S = (A, C, R, M)

Where:

A ⊆ Ω          Active operators  
C ⊆ A × A      Coupling relations  
R               Recursion depth  
M               Memory persistence  

---

## 2. Complexity Function

Define operator complexity as:

𝓒(S) = |A| + |C| + R + M

Where:

|A|  = number of active operators  
|C|  = number of distinct couplings  
R    = recursion order  
M    = structural memory persistence factor  

Complexity increases when:

- More operators are active
- More operator couplings exist
- Recursion depth increases
- Memory accumulation modifies κ

This metric is independent of physical size or chronological time.

Time and scale emerge as consequences of operator complexity.

## 3. Complexity Levels

### Level I — Single Operator Dominance
𝓒 minimal  
|A| = 1  
No stable coupling  
No persistence  

### Level II — Dual Interaction
|A| = 2  
|C| ≥ 1  
No durable recurrence  

### Level III — Triadic Interaction
|A| = 3  
Constraint begins shaping continuation  

### Level IV — Primary Closure
|A| = 4  
First stable ω  
Persistent events possible  

### Level V — Stable Recurrence
Full σ–τ–κ–ω cycling  
Local persistence loops  

### Level VI — Coupled Recurrence Networks
Multiple stable loops interacting  

### Level VII — Memory Accumulation
κ modified by prior ω  
Path dependence  

### Level VIII — Recursive Regulation
Systems regulating their own cycling  

### Level IX — Anticipatory Simulation
Simulation of ω prior to commitment  

### Level X — Admissibility Governance
Regulation of κ itself  
Closure about closure

# Ordering Principle

The book progresses by increasing:

- Operator participation
- Coupling density
- Recursion depth
- Memory persistence
- Admissibility governance

Chronology and physical scale are secondary effects of operator complexity.
